# Main Heading (H1)

This is a paragraph demonstrating the default text styling. It uses the `davy_gray` color with relaxed line height for optimal readability. This paragraph also includes a [styled link](#) that demonstrates the hover effects with the `thistle` accent color.

## Secondary Heading (H2)

Here's another paragraph with **bold text** and _italic text_ to show different text styles. The paragraph spacing creates a comfortable reading rhythm.

### Tertiary Heading (H3)

This section demonstrates lists and code elements.

#### Quaternary Heading (H4)

##### Quinary Heading (H5)

###### Senary Heading (H6)

## Code Examples

Here's some `inline code` within a paragraph. Inline code uses a subtle background color from the platinum palette.

Here's a code block:

```javascript
// Code blocks have syntax highlighting support
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
function sayHello(name) {
  return `${greeting} My name is ${name}`;
}
console.log(sayHello("Nikita"));
```

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote element. It uses the thistle accent color for the left border and has a subtle platinum background. Blockquotes are great for highlighting important quotes or callouts.
>
> Multiple paragraphs in blockquotes are supported with proper spacing.
