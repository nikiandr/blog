Language in general is a very lossy interface for our thoughts.
No phrase or sentence can explain what goes through your mind when you wake up 5 minutes before daily standup and almost instantly made to recall every single thing you planned for today. Even if this sentence would be 1000 words long.

Paragraph about communication problems caused by it

On the other hand this narrowing of information when using language is a powerful instrument.

Narrowness of language allows us to convey wider concepts but also direct the meaning more narrowly.

Concept of a wedge <Sidenote id="1">https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/wedge</Sidenote>: it's meaning in a wall climbing sense, etc.

Other example - concept of exit 

<Figure src={osloPhoto} alt="Oslo photo" caption="Some photo"/>

These terms are how founders and other actors in the industry tell stories about themselves.

That also means that we can use same language to tell stories about ourselves.
